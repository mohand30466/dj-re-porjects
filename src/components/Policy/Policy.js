            An Intellectual Property clause will inform users that the contents,
            logo and other visual media you created is your property and is
            protected by copyright laws. A Termination clause will inform users
            that any accounts on your website and mobile app, or users' access
            to your website and app, can be terminated in case of abuses or at
            your sole discretion. A Governing Law clause will inform users which
            laws govern the agreement. These laws should come from the country
            in which your company is headquartered or the country from which you
            operate your website and mobile app. A Links to Other Websites
            clause will inform users that you are not responsible for any third
            party websites that you link to. This kind of clause will generally
            inform users that they are responsible for reading and agreeing (or
            disagreeing) with the Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policies of
            these third parties. If your website or mobile app allows users to
            create content and make that content public to other users, a
            Content clause will inform users that they own the rights to the
            content they have created. This clause usually mentions that users
            must give you (the website or mobile app developer/owner) a license
            so that you can share this content on your website/mobile app and to
            make it available to other users. Because the content created by
            users is public to other users, a DMCA notice clause (or Copyright
            Infringement ) section is helpful to inform users and copyright
            authors that, if any content is found to be a copyright
            infringement, you will respond to any DMCA takedown notices received
            and you will take down the content. A Limit What Users Can Do clause
            can inform users that by agreeing to use your service, they're also
            agreeing to not do certain things. This can be part of a very long
            and thorough list in your Terms and Conditions agreement so as to
            encompass the most amount of negative uses.
